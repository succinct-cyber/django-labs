# django-labs

A collection of focused Django projects exploring backend engineering concepts.

Each folder represents an isolated lab covering topics such as:
- authentication and access control
- REST APIs
- subscriptions and permissions
- backend system design patterns

These labs are intentionally small and documented as proof of work.
