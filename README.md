# django-labs

A collection of focused Django projects exploring backend engineering concepts.

Each folder represents an isolated lab covering topics such as:
- authentication and access control
- REST APIs
- subscriptions and permissions
- backend system design patterns

These labs are intentionally small and documented as proof of work

## API (Django REST Framework)

This project exposes an authenticated API endpoint:

- `GET /api/profile/`
- Requires login
- Returns basic user identity data

This mirrors how backend services expose user data to frontends and dashboards.
